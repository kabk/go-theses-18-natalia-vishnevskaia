			The problem of distinction between mind and body was addressed by many philosophers and scientists throughout the history of humankind, as well as the problem of what is in dominance and what is suppressed. Can we locate the soul? What effects mental events have on physical state of a human being? 
			Having a vast historical baggage we are now able to look at the mind-body problem from multiple perspectives. Plato believed that the soul is immortal and trapped inside of the body until it dies, whilst John Searle, a contemporary American philosopher claims that the mind is a part of physical activities of a body and exist only when the body functions. Materialistic philosophy of posthumanists strives to eliminate the boundaries of human body, in comparison to the ideas of liberation of the Divine spark and union of the holistic spirit, which can be found in some religious systems such as gnosticism.<br><br>
			The spiritualization and abstraction of body was also favored by some supporters of enlightenment, who claimed that the physical senses will be gradually surpassed by the mind.
			Take a sense of distance — in our time it is obvious that the physical position of our body is no longer a barrier for communication and interaction with people from the other part of the world. Considering the speed with which the enhancement of our bodily senses is taking place we can predict that in the near future this tendency can lead to the complete replacement of the senses. 
			There are already results on the successful surgeries in changing of human genome and replacing missing limbs with high quality prosthesis. Not to mention the increasing interest in artificial intelligence, which in any of its manifestations will be the reason to reconsider the human consciousness once again. Technology evolves so rapidly and the exponential growth of the hardware productivity and processing power is becoming an alarming sign of our inevitable end in a technological singularity. According to some researchers, already by the end of the 21st century we will be living in a complete simulation. However, it is important to understand that the drastic irretrievable changes might happen much faster than we expect. Is there anything we can do in order to prevent them and would it make any sense at all?

			<br><br>
			Although we already accepted the vast development of technology and how it surrounds us in everyday life, it is not entirely possible for us to comprehend the highly advanced tools. Especially for the people who are barely familiar with the processes running on the background — above all they will not even get the chance to protest. We know just fractions of what is built around us and it often brings the sense of irritation, uncertainty, discomfort and even fear. 
			<br><br>
			As human beings we have a natural yearn for simplicity and clear understanding of the nature of things. There is an arousing need for approachable, visible, tactile objects, which prove that we actually still physical beings which exist in this overly digitalized environment. Eye can be very deceiptive, and with the advancing technologies of augmented reality the vision becomes even more unreliable. It might happen in the end that only by touching object one will be able to contemplate the presence of both the object and thyself.<br>
			“Seeing is believing, but feeling is the truth” —  Thomas Fuller.

			This paper is a collection of stories and thoughts written from a perspective of the Observer in a form of a diary. We will join him on his retrospective journey, looking through his eyes, witnessing constant oscillations between physical and mental and the relationships they have, briefly look at some of the choices which were made or could’ve been made and what role technology plays in reshaping human’s relationship with heir bodily senses.<br><br>
			Yesterday I couldn’t fall asleep for several hours — you know this kind of feeling, when you suddenly get a brilliant idea right after you lay your head on a pillow. I was over enthusiastic with my thoughts and I rolled around the bed (my king-size bed allows me to do it), wrapping myself in a blanket until it completely swallowed me like a carnivorous plant swallows the fly; only then I could finally fell asleep. Even though it often happens that in the morning the idea you had the night before is not attractive anymore and seems superficial, this morning it wasn’t the case. <br>
			I stood up and I felt an urge to start acting straight away. <br><br>
			For quite a while I didn’t travel anywhere — I had no clue what could be my next destination. But yesterday, before I got to bed, I took my phone to set up alarm clock and realized that this device is the last thing I interact with in the end of the day and the first when I wake up.<br> Isn’t it bizarre how just in two decades we gained a new extension of ourselves — something which we have skin-to-skin contact more than to anything or anyone else in life. <br> And what will happen in the next two decades? Or more? Are we going to obtain more extensions and become complete cyborgs or do we have another direction to go? What I am afraid about is that there might happen a moment when we don’t know ourselves anymore and what we well see from our augmented reality glasses will be far distant from the reality around us. Will the focus on physical interactions help to remain more down to earth? <br><br> I realized that I needed to make a new trip somewhere and to some time where I will try to find an answer to this questions. But in order to do that, as usual I needed to go sleep. Only through my dreams I can visit the places which can’t be found on regular maps. <br><br>The day has just started… Can’t wait to go sleep again.

			<p>Oh, how close they got to human reasoning. However, it took them decades to learn how to perceive the physical world around them and how to navigate in space — first robots took hours to find and pick up a few blocks on the table, and sometimes they would even fail completely. And no wonder why it took them so long to acquire these skills — experience about the nature is encoded in the largest and oldest parts of the human brain. Survival instinct takes its birth from the moment when first two-cells living being won in the competition over food or space. Human brains kept these billions years of intuitive and sensorimotor experiences. However, the rationale and logic processes are much younger, thus it was easier to imitate them for first robotic intellects. <br><br>
			Thousand of years later, they exceeded humans’ physical abilities and intelligence. The machines are able to reproduce themselves and since they are not restricted anymore by human whim or preconceptions, they vary immensely in shape, size, function and surpassed the existing biosphere in diversity. I’ve seen malicious hardware parasites of planetary scale, when I still had eyes. They easily navigate in space, analyzing millions of models of interactions and their consequences before they take any action — faster than the human thought can born.
			<br><br>
			However I still have doubts on their ability think as humans and intuit.
			<br><br>
			Slow pace of human learning and its even slower biological evolution is no longer a barrier for new generations of intellectual machines. Our nature was evolving at very leisurely pace, with each step taken a million of years, in comparison to the agonizingly rapid development of the machines. They became more capable than any human in any occupation. What I have left, when computers could do my research and write a book instead of me? What happened to all artists, who’s works were suppressed by self-improving and personalized works of art?
			When nail clipper became smarter than any human, the only thing which was left for a human being is to dispose their body and keep only the mind. 
			I was no longer made out of neurones and proteins — the human brain is too sensitive to radiation. My nervous system was replaced by the exact same computer simulation. Layer by layer my brain was scanned and my mind was transferred to more stable and long lasting place, a new mechanical body.
			I no longer a halfbreed — partly biological, partly cultural. All my biological traits became unnecessary baggage, and my mind was rescued from the limitation of my physical nature.
			My reactions were so rapid and the perception of time changed dramatically compared to my biological brain. If I drop an object, I could read a whole "Philosophiæ Naturalis” by Newton while it falls down, and than catch it. My attention span has also increased. I am not bored anymore, present interests have lost their relevance, so I can comfortably work on long-term problems.  <br>
			What is the body? Why people were so afraid of losing it? It is just an abstract pattern. The body constantly loses its cells and replace them every few years, every atom of the body is changing throughout the lifetime. There is only a process of keeping the atoms in specific pattern. 
			And every pattern can be reorganized. It can also be transmitted. And when even the matter transmitters became obsolete, shortly after a few human communities posed a question: if the mind is an abstraction as well, why does it need a body at all? The mind is code, it is mathematics, and it is going to live even if it doesn’t have physical properties. Mathematical equations exist even if they were not written down. 
			<br><br>
			I refused to have any body at all. I duplicated my mind for the people who still wanted to have a material form. As a gesture of gratitude towards my material nature, I copied simulations of my mind to synchronized machines and they run with different speeds, their intervals and varying frequencies produced sublime mathematical music.<br><br>
			My mind is pure information. It can be encoded in any form. I can become a light ray, beaming from a planet to an endless universe. One can receive me and integrate to his memory. It is hard to say, where I ends. I even cannot say where my memories have originated from — many minds merged together in one, like hundred creeks empty themselves in a river.<br><br>
			I never sleep. I never dream. But I think. I have a whole universe opened to me, I have access to all possible knowledge. I’ve jumped into the abyss without bottom. I am absolutely concentrated and dispersed. My thought is like a tree trunk, with branches spreading in every direction, becoming longer and thinner and producing more and more branches. <br><br>
			I see mercury tornados, interstellar whales, laughing grass on a football field. I can lift a dark matter and find a gravitational worms under it. 
			<br><br>
			My imagination is shaping my reality.
			After all, does it really matter that I am a simulation? The world I exist in complete by itself.

			<p>I was squeezed in a tiny capsule, my head touches the knees. The capsule was falling back to the Earth after a long trip between the planets. Everything looked grey, as if I couldn’t distinct the colors. I woke up. Are there any colors at all in the outer space? After all, the images we have from NASA being vividly coloured later in the image redactors…<br><br>
			Such a strange feelings I have after this dream. It was a distant future, dominated by intelligent machines, and all the goods in that world were so cheap and plentiful, so humans’ only goal was to find the most entertaining activity. In fact, most of the people business was to amuse each other. Regular labour became passe. 
			<br><br>
			Is the future, where we don’t have to work, really what we desire? Will global economy allow to cover the whole planet? Will the progress of automation and artificial intelligence touch African tribes or Chinese peasants? Or are they simply irrelevant to the future technological development?.. 
			<br>
			In a classic Jewish story, a pious carter dies and God grants his heartfelt desire to continue to be a carter in the World to Come. I find this example very close to what I feel about my job which I would never agree on passing to the machines.
			<br><br>
			I needed to stand up and do my morning routine before I go to work, but I could hardly move my fingers. My body was so numb as if there was no current going through it any longer.

			<h1 class="title" id="secondtitle">(Virtual) Reality</h1>
			<p>A week ago I was a Norwegian fisherman.<br>
			Yesterday I was a 12-year old girl from Peru.<br>
			Today I am a designer of virtual worlds.<br>
			It’s ok to have dozens of personalities online. Except for having ability to easily switch genders, it is no difference from the chameleon-like behaviour of of people in the offline life. <br>
			You might only start worrying when you perceive no difference between the two.
			<br><br>
			There are certain characteristics of virtual worlds. Computer simulations turned regular physics into information conveyed through symbols. I know that something should look like this, and I expect it to behave in some specific way. But the beauty of virtual worlds lies in the fact that the behaviour of elements within it depends on the programmer’s imagination rather than on the way things happen on this Euclidian-Newtonian earth. If I drop an object in the virtual world, it might just go up or even multiply and go sideways — the laws of this world can be logical and consistent, but not necessarily with real physics. The symbols become the reality.
			<br><br>
			There is another distinctive feature which users face in digital worlds, especially when using virtual reality headsets. Actions taken in the virtual world often have a serious time lag, but this technical detail must be solved very soon with the advance of computational power.
			<br><br>
			Actually, there is a certain danger of having constant access to virtual and augmented reality headsets and glasses. It lies in the fact that when you take the display off, you not only might feel a slight nausea, but also an effect which Michael Heim called “Alternate World Syndrome”. How he explained it, after hours of immersion in 360-degree simulation in 1994 (one of the first virtual reality artworks, ‘Virtual Dervish’ was made by Marcos Novak, Diane Gromala and Yakov Sharir and exhibited at the Banff Centre for Arts in Canada), “everything seem brighter, even slightly illusory. Reality seems hidden beneath a thin film of appearance”. He felt that the world was vibrating as if something was about to break through the film of illusion. I wouldn’t say that I feel such a tension, but I agree that the world without virtual glasses strangely transforms into a surface which feels like a flat screen. Augmented elements, hovering over real-world objects confuse the eye, blurring the sense of perspective.
			<br><br>
			There is also a desktop version of virtual reality, with a through-the-window view serving as a confined format of virtual existence. 
			The overly experienced visitors of virtual worlds often have peculiar sensations when they deal with regular reality. Images and expectations of virtual world blend with the real, and we are tend to make more mistakes or improper gestures. I can’t count the times when I unconsciously tried to mentally press the cmd+z combination after doing something wrong with a physical object — for instance, when writing or drawing something on paper. Things can become even more confusing. Every time when I use a right-click context menu to copy something, I feel a slight pressure on my right hand, as if something ephemeral was inserted into it. This feeling can be, in a way, very useful. Sometimes due to my lack of attention I might forget what I was doing and start browsing things or switch to another project, but after I notice that the feeling in my right hand is still exist I realize that I actually forgot to paste something. Proprioceptive senses of my body developed in junction with my indistinguishable computer prosthesis. <br><br>
