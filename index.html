			<span id="formal">The problem of distinction between mind and body was addressed by many philosophers and scientists throughout the history of humankind, as well as the problem of what is in dominance and what is suppressed. Can we locate the soul? What effects mental events have on physical state of a human being? 
			Having a vast historical baggage we are now able to look at the mind-body problem from multiple perspectives. Plato believed that the soul is immortal and trapped inside of the body until it dies, whilst John Searle, a contemporary American philosopher claims that the mind is a part of physical activities of a body and exist only when the body functions. Materialistic philosophy of posthumanists strives to eliminate the boundaries of human body, in comparison to the ideas of liberation of the Divine spark and union of the holistic spirit, which can be found in some religious systems such as gnosticism.<br><br>
			The spiritualization and abstraction of body was also favored by some supporters of enlightenment, who claimed that the physical senses will be gradually surpassed by the mind.
			Take a sense of distance — in our time it is obvious that the physical position of our body is no longer a barrier for communication and interaction with people from the other part of the world. Considering the speed with which the enhancement of our bodily senses is taking place we can predict that in the near future this tendency can lead to the complete replacement of the senses. 
			There are already results on the successful surgeries in changing of human genome and replacing missing limbs with high quality prosthesis. Not to mention the increasing interest in artificial intelligence, which in any of its manifestations will be the reason to reconsider the human consciousness once again. Technology evolves so rapidly and the exponential growth of the hardware productivity and processing power is becoming an alarming sign of our inevitable end in a technological singularity. According to some researchers, already by the end of the 21st century we will be living in a complete simulation. However, it is important to understand that the drastic irretrievable changes might happen much faster than we expect. Is there anything we can do in order to prevent them and would it make any sense at all?
			<br><br>
			Although we already accepted the vast development of technology and how it surrounds us in everyday life, it is not entirely possible for us to comprehend the highly advanced tools. Especially for the people who are barely familiar with the processes running on the background — above all they will not even get the chance to protest. We know just fractions of what is built around us and it often brings the sense of irritation, uncertainty, discomfort and even fear. 
			<br><br>
			As human beings we have a natural yearn for simplicity and clear understanding of the nature of things. There is an arousing need for approachable, visible, tactile objects, which prove that we actually still physical beings which exist in this overly digitalized environment. Eye can be very deceiptive, and with the advancing technologies of augmented reality the vision becomes even more unreliable. It might happen in the end that only by touching object one will be able to contemplate the presence of both the object and thyself.<br>
			“Seeing is believing, but feeling is the truth” —  Thomas Fuller.
			<br><br>
			This paper is a collection of stories and thoughts written from a perspective of the Observer in a form of a diary. We will join him on his retrospective journey, looking through his eyes, witnessing constant oscillations between physical and mental and the relationships they have, briefly look at some of the choices which were made or could’ve been made and what role technology plays in reshaping human’s relationship with heir bodily senses.

			Yesterday I couldn’t fall asleep for several hours — you know this kind of feeling, when you suddenly get a brilliant idea right after you lay your head on a pillow. I was over enthusiastic with my thoughts and I rolled around the bed (my king-size bed allows me to do it), wrapping myself in a blanket until it completely swallowed me like a carnivorous plant swallows the fly; only then I could finally fell asleep. Even though it often happens that in the morning the idea you had the night before is not attractive anymore and seems superficial, this morning it wasn’t the case. <br>
			I stood up and I felt an urge to start acting straight away. <br><br>
			For quite a while I didn’t travel anywhere — I had no clue what could be my next destination. But yesterday, before I got to bed, I took my phone to set up alarm clock and realized that this device is the last thing I interact with in the end of the day and the first when I wake up.<br> Isn’t it bizarre how just in two decades we gained a new extension of ourselves — something which we have skin-to-skin contact more than to anything or anyone else in life. <br> And what will happen in the next two decades? Or more? Are we going to obtain more extensions and become complete cyborgs or do we have another direction to go? What I am afraid about is that there might happen a moment when we don’t know ourselves anymore and what we well see from our augmented reality glasses will be far distant from the reality around us. Will the focus on physical interactions help to remain more down to earth? <br><br> I realized that I needed to make a new trip somewhere and to some time where I will try to find an answer to this questions. But in order to do that, as usual I needed to go sleep. Only through my dreams I can visit the places which can’t be found on regular maps. <br><br>The day has just started… Can’t wait to go sleep again.

			<h1 class="title" id="secondtitle">After the Sun Expansion </h1>
			<p class="subhead">Oh, how close they got to human reasoning. However, it took them decades to learn how to perceive the physical world around them and how to navigate in space — first robots took hours to find and pick up a few blocks on the table, and sometimes they would even fail completely. And no wonder why it took them so long to acquire these skills — experience about the nature is encoded in the largest and oldest parts of the human brain. Survival instinct takes its birth from the moment when first two-cells living being won in the competition over food or space. Human brains kept these billions years of intuitive and sensorimotor experiences. However, the rationale and logic processes are much younger, thus it was easier to imitate them for first robotic intellects. <br><br>
			Thousand of years later, they exceeded humans’ physical abilities and intelligence. The machines are able to reproduce themselves and since they are not restricted anymore by human whim or preconceptions, they vary immensely in shape, size, function and surpassed the existing biosphere in diversity. I’ve seen malicious hardware parasites of planetary scale, when I still had eyes. They easily navigate in space, analyzing millions of models of interactions and their consequences before they take any action — faster than the human thought can born.
			<br><br>
			However I still have doubts on their ability think as humans and intuit.
			<br><br>
			Slow pace of human learning and its even slower biological evolution is no longer a barrier for new generations of intellectual machines. Our nature was evolving at very leisurely pace, with each step taken a million of years, in comparison to the agonizingly rapid development of the machines. They became more capable than any human in any occupation. What I have left, when computers could do my research and write a book instead of me? What happened to all artists, who’s works were suppressed by self-improving and personalized works of art?
			When nail clipper became smarter than any human, the only thing which was left for a human being is to dispose their body and keep only the mind. 
			I was no longer made out of neurones and proteins — the human brain is too sensitive to radiation. My nervous system was replaced by the exact same computer simulation. Layer by layer my brain was scanned and my mind was transferred to more stable and long lasting place, a new mechanical body.
			I no longer a halfbreed — partly biological, partly cultural. All my biological traits became unnecessary baggage, and my mind was rescued from the limitation of my physical nature.
			My reactions were so rapid and the perception of time changed dramatically compared to my biological brain. If I drop an object, I could read a whole "Philosophiæ Naturalis” by Newton while it falls down, and than catch it. My attention span has also increased. I am not bored anymore, present interests have lost their relevance, so I can comfortably work on long-term problems.  <br>
			What is the body? Why people were so afraid of losing it? It is just an abstract pattern. The body constantly loses its cells and replace them every few years, every atom of the body is changing throughout the lifetime. There is only a process of keeping the atoms in specific pattern. 
			And every pattern can be reorganized. It can also be transmitted. And when even the matter transmitters became obsolete, shortly after a few human communities posed a question: if the mind is an abstraction as well, why does it need a body at all? The mind is code, it is mathematics, and it is going to live even if it doesn’t have physical properties. Mathematical equations exist even if they were not written down. 
			<br><br>
			I refused to have any body at all. I duplicated my mind for the people who still wanted to have a material form. As a gesture of gratitude towards my material nature, I copied simulations of my mind to synchronized machines and they run with different speeds, their intervals and varying frequencies produced sublime mathematical music.<br><br>
			My mind is pure information. It can be encoded in any form. I can become a light ray, beaming from a planet to an endless universe. One can receive me and integrate to his memory. It is hard to say, where I ends. I even cannot say where my memories have originated from — many minds merged together in one, like hundred creeks empty themselves in a river.<br><br>
			I never sleep. I never dream. But I think. I have a whole universe opened to me, I have access to all possible knowledge. I’ve jumped into the abyss without bottom. I am absolutely concentrated and dispersed. My thought is like a tree trunk, with branches spreading in every direction, becoming longer and thinner and producing more and more branches. <br><br>
			I see mercury tornados, interstellar whales, laughing grass on a football field. I can lift a dark matter and find a gravitational worms under it. 
			<br><br>
			My imagination is shaping my reality.
			After all, does it really matter that I am a simulation? The world I exist in complete by itself.

			<h1 class="title" id="secondtitle">Alternative Labour</h1>
			<p>I was squeezed in a tiny capsule, my head touches the knees. The capsule was falling back to the Earth after a long trip between the planets. Everything looked grey, as if I couldn’t distinct the colors. I woke up. Are there any colors at all in the outer space? After all, the images we have from NASA being vividly coloured later in the image redactors…<br><br>
			Such a strange feelings I have after this dream. It was a distant future, dominated by intelligent machines, and all the goods in that world were so cheap and plentiful, so humans’ only goal was to find the most entertaining activity. In fact, most of the people business was to amuse each other. Regular labour became passe. 
			<br><br>
			Is the future, where we don’t have to work, really what we desire? Will global economy allow to cover the whole planet? Will the progress of automation and artificial intelligence touch African tribes or Chinese peasants? Or are they simply irrelevant to the future technological development?.. 
			<br>
			In a classic Jewish story, a pious carter dies and God grants his heartfelt desire to continue to be a carter in the World to Come. I find this example very close to what I feel about my job which I would never agree on passing to the machines.
			<br><br>
			I needed to stand up and do my morning routine before I go to work, but I could hardly move my fingers. My body was so numb as if there was no current going through it any longer.

			<h1 class="title" id="secondtitle">(Virtual) Reality</h1>
			<p>A week ago I was a Norwegian fisherman.<br>
			Yesterday I was a 12-year old girl from Peru.<br>
			Today I am a designer of virtual worlds.<br>
			It’s ok to have dozens of personalities online. Except for having ability to easily switch genders, it is no difference from the chameleon-like behaviour of of people in the offline life. <br>
			You might only start worrying when you perceive no difference between the two.
			<br><br>
			There are certain characteristics of virtual worlds. Computer simulations turned regular physics into information conveyed through symbols. I know that something should look like this, and I expect it to behave in some specific way. But the beauty of virtual worlds lies in the fact that the behaviour of elements within it depends on the programmer’s imagination rather than on the way things happen on this Euclidian-Newtonian earth. If I drop an object in the virtual world, it might just go up or even multiply and go sideways — the laws of this world can be logical and consistent, but not necessarily with real physics. The symbols become the reality.
			<br><br>
			There is another distinctive feature which users face in digital worlds, especially when using virtual reality headsets. Actions taken in the virtual world often have a serious time lag, but this technical detail must be solved very soon with the advance of computational power.
			<br><br>
			<img id="imgfirst" src="images/dervish1.jpg"><img id="imgsecond" src="images/dervish2.jpg"><br><span class="txt frst"> "Dancing with the Virtual Dervish", Yacov Sharir and Diane Gromala, 1994</span>
			Actually, there is a certain danger of having constant access to virtual and augmented reality headsets and glasses. It lies in the fact that when you take the display off, you not only might feel a slight nausea, but also an effect which Michael Heim called “Alternate World Syndrome”. How he explained it, after hours of immersion in 360-degree simulation in 1994 (one of the first virtual reality artworks, ‘Virtual Dervish’ was made by Marcos Novak, Diane Gromala and Yakov Sharir and exhibited at the Banff Centre for Arts in Canada), “everything seem brighter, even slightly illusory. Reality seems hidden beneath a thin film of appearance”. He felt that the world was vibrating as if something was about to break through the film of illusion. I wouldn’t say that I feel such a tension, but I agree that the world without virtual glasses strangely transforms into a surface which feels like a flat screen. Augmented elements, hovering over real-world objects confuse the eye, blurring the sense of perspective. 
			<br><br>
			There is also a desktop version of virtual reality, with a through-the-window view serving as a confined format of virtual existence. 
			The overly experienced visitors of virtual worlds often have peculiar sensations when they deal with regular reality. Images and expectations of virtual world blend with the real, and we are tend to make more mistakes or improper gestures. I can’t count the times when I unconsciously tried to mentally press the cmd+z combination after doing something wrong with a physical object — for instance, when writing or drawing something on paper. Things can become even more confusing. Every time when I use a right-click context menu to copy something, I feel a slight pressure on my right hand, as if something ephemeral was inserted into it. This feeling can be, in a way, very useful. Sometimes due to my lack of attention I might forget what I was doing and start browsing things or switch to another project, but after I notice that the feeling in my right hand is still exist I realize that I actually forgot to paste something. Proprioceptive senses of my body developed in junction with my indistinguishable computer prosthesis. <br><br>

			<h1 class="title" id="secondtitle">Body Modification</h1>
			<p>My infrared sensor recorded a subtle changes in the room as it got heated up under the morning sun. It sent me an electric stimuli to my brain providing an information saying that now is the best temperature more me to stand up. I was already awake for a while but felt too comfy to get out of the bed. I had a light pulsation behind my left eye — that was an alarm signal which I turned off by blinking few times. <br>
			Today is the 24th of May, and on the same day, in 1844, Samuel Morse strung a wire along a railroad between Washington and Baltimore and using his code tapped out the message "What hath God wrought” on the first 38-mile telegraph line. Later it lead to the invention of telephone, then computer networks, internet, smartphones, brain implants… <br>
			But before that people wrote letters.<br>And because of letters well-known painter became an inventor of the telegraph. 
			<br><br>
			Almost twenty years before that, he traveled to Washington to work on a painting commission for 
			the city of New York which promised him a thousand dollars for a portrait of Marquis de Lafayette. He wrote a letter to his wife Lucretia, longing to hear from her, as she was expecting their third child, however the response he received was from his father who informed him that his wife has died while recovering from childbirth. Morse rushed back home, but by the time he got back to New Haven, which is located four-days away from Washington, his wife was already buried. 
			<br><br>
			This story is a very heart-breaking, and I truly understand why his grief eventually transformed into a stimulation for technological development. The slow communication of hundreds of years ago can not be compared to the advanced methods of communication which we use in contemporary society. Quite fast we sorted out the distance and the speed of information transmission though it took a while to remove the physical interfaces which were necessary to interact with. 

			<br><br><img id="imgfirst" src="images/warwick.jpg"><br><span class="txt scnd"> Kewin Warwick, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at Coventry University</span>
			It started with a few biohacking pioneers of the end of 20th century and beginning of 21st. Kevin Warwick, being a professor of cybernetics at Coventry University in England, undergone several surgical procedures to implant electronic devices into his body, including a 100-electrode sensor grid into the nerves in his elbow that feed his hand and arm. By capturing electrical signals flowing down his arm, Warwick was able to control a robotic wheelchair, and remote-control a robotic hand over the Internet. Believing that cognitive augmentation is only a few years away, he’s experimented by expanding his own senses. In 2002, he and his wife Irena installed matching implants that recorded signals from their central nervous system. Most of the time they were able to correctly identify each other’s nerve signals. That was the beginning of brain-to-brain communication. When he explained what he felt during the experiment, he said: “It didn’t feel like pain or heat or seeing. It was like an entirely new sense. And that was part of the experiment: to see if the brain can adapt and take on new types of input and learn to understand. The brain is very clever like that — I just want to see how far we can push it.”
			<br><br>
			He assumed that the phones and brains both function with electric currents thus there is nothing what keeps us away from transmitting the brain impulses through the ways akin to wifi. For Warwick talking felt outdated and he continuously affirmed that the way development of technology was working at that time was in designing it around the abilities which we have as human beings, and he wants to redesign humans and technology together.	<br><br> 
			He sought to use implanted electrodes and neural stimulators to manage conditions like Parkinson’s, paralysis, and addiction disorders. And now the benefits of Deep Brain Stimulation go beyond restorative therapy and extend to personality augmentation. The possibilities it brings are numerous and I’m afraid I won’t be able to list them all straight away. Students can stay awake and alert for days because the stimulation tells the brain it doesn’t need sleep, soldiers can feel no fear when faced with the unimaginable stresses of life in a combat zone and doctors can easily understand problems of patients by connecting to their neural systems.<br><br> 
			But Warwick wasn’t the only who was trying to push the limits of the human form.<br><br>
			<img id="imgfirst" src="images/mann.jpg"><br><span class="txt third">Prof. Steve Mann with Generation-4 EyeTap</span>
			Steve Mann has been called “the father of wearable computing.” He’s been wearing various augmented reality devices for years, starting with "Digital Eye Glass” in 1978. One of his models called EyeTap and it was physically attached to his skull by several screws.<br> The device allowed the eye itself to function as both a display and a camera. It displayed computer information to the user and allowed to alter what the user sees. This means that the device was able to augment, diminish, or otherwise alter a user's visual perception of the environment. When no computer mediation is used, EyeTap video could be displayed to the user in such a way that the user perceives what he/she would otherwise have in the absence of the device. Using this device, long before webcams, somewhere in the end of 20th century, Mann's website attracted 30,000 hits a day when he began broadcasting his life 24 hours a day while being a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br><br> However, at that time laws and reactions on modified human bodies in public spaces were in such a state that now would be considered decadent. There were plenty of responds such as the one of McDonalds crew towards Steve Mann in 2012, when the workers tried to pull the glasses off Steve’s head when he was having a lunch there with his family. However, the glasses were permanently attached to the skull with screws so the professor was eventually just pushed on the street. Another time he just missed the lecture he was supposed to give because airport security wouldn't let him on the plane with his gear.<br><br> Our society had to go through it all, through the regulations, reconstruction of current legislations,  and of course it was required to gain a lot of trust towards each other and technology we eventually became one with. <br><br>But that was long time ago… It was the dawn of the body modification history. Now, when we dealt with all possible pitfalls there is no chance to distinct where does the human body ends and where the extension begins.

			Since last few centuries hormonal and genetic tuning became a medical routine. 
			Biological technologies are being used to enhance human beings, improving their function and altering their look. It is no longer limited to artificial hearts and limbs; their implementations varying from extra-strong bones and general body growth which everyone use to their own advantage.
			<br><br>
			Many things changed after all ethical and technical issues were solved and designer babies became regular business. Mechanically generated offspring (genetically modified embryos) carry either no risk or a reduced risk of any genetic diseases, plus they include desirable traits of the people who place an order. Quite often some specimens were allowed to be shared as an open-source model for biological programmers to experiment with, and the results of the experiments considered to be something which humanity can be proud of. People of our time consider the human condition as something to be improved and nature as simply a tool to improve it. Now for the first time, we gained the ability to control the evolutionary process in a conscious way.
			Human population now varying in sizes, shapes and colors. In order to keep balance on Earth, the leaders developed corporate laws which allow the modification until a certain point. That included a transformation to the immense sizes which could be considered as dangerous. From time to time, some rules are of course being broken by the rebellious programmers who clandestinely work in their labs and their creations might live relatively long if they are unnoticed. 
			Reproduction is allowed, but the intercourse between the two designer babies sometimes could lead to unpredictable results. 

			<br><br>I was one of them. <br><br>
			I looked pretty regular, and to be honest, I never was a huge fan of body modifications. I rarely did genome updates, which were pretty common for my generation. These often contain some changes like the ability to see the ultraviolet rays or replacing normal teeth to metallic; usually I don’t bother myself with such unnecessary things. I knew it was safe to use them, but I still had these concerns that genome editing anyways has the risk of changes being made to healthy or improper genes by accident. However, today morning for some reason I decided to update my genome code, and as I expected, something went wrong. 
			<br><br>
			Apparently, my genetic code wasn’t compatible with this new version. Immediately, my body started to grow and strengthen, and my hands and feet lengthened. Suddenly my hand split into four smaller ones, each half the size of my normal hand. I’ve made a backup before upgrade, so I could restore it if there will appear some uncontrollable mutation, but for now I was just observing the peculiar transformation which I’ve never experienced before. My limbs grew exponentially and I started to look like a tree with limbs like stems, repeatedly branching into thinner, shorter and more thinner and shorter branches. I had to go outside since I couldn’t fit in the building anymore. My hands end in an astronomical number of microscopic cilia, trillions of tiny fingers, each a millionth of a meter long and tenth of that in diameter. Because of their smaller weight and size, the fingers can move a million times as fast as the base. I couldn’t even calculate it properly — let’s say that the base hand can move bak and forth once per second, then the tiny fingers will vibrate a million times per second. That was mesmerizing. People on the streets stopped and started pointing at me. I continued to expand, I already exceeded the height of the trees growing next to my house. I found out that each branch of my hands can rotate on its axis and change its length like a telescope. I started to enjoy my immensely delicate body. The smallest finger-branchlets not exceeded a few atoms in scale, allowing me to grab individual atoms and assemble them in the way which wasn’t meant by nature. 


			<br><br>I felt that the laws of physics seems to melt.
			<br><br>
			Can you imagine how sensitive my body was? Each of the tiny fingers was able to sense a movement of a tenth of a micron and a force of a few micrograms. The speed of their movement is greater than the sensing ability of a regular human eye. I imagined, if I put my fingers on a photograph, I will be able to “see” the images in detail by feeling the height variations of the ink on a paper. In some way I could say my superior touch senses substituted vision. I can reach into any complex structure, even the living organism - the extreme dexterity eliminated the need for any special tools. 
			<br><br> 
			I continued to enlarge and expand, stretching my fingers to the sides, blocking the roads, turning upside down police cars, replacing the wind molecules with fire. I imagined the world full of creatures like me, who have superb coordination, astronomical speed of reaction and enormous sensitivity to the environment. That was the future. 
			<br><br>
			Once we were shaped by the hand of Darwinian evolution, but now we can actually guide it.

			<h1 class="title" id="secondtitle">End</h1>
			<p>Today I had a dialog with my own mind. <br>
			How can it possibly be, you can ask me. I don’t know either. But I woke up this morning, — nothing seems suspicious —  and I walked to the balcony as the weather was nice and sunny and I wanted to wash my face with lazy light rays, which we already knocking at my window for a half an hour. I took a deep breath of the breezy air, felt a strong sweet-sour smell of seaweed, which warmed up under the sun and started to emit the recognizible aroma of the sea perfume. Oh, how I love this scent. If only I could smell it more often.
			<br>
			I stretched in joy and walked into the kitchen to prepare my breakfast. Simple sandwich with cheese and some fruits will do. I took a bite of a peach and almost cracked my teeth — it was surprisingly so hard and stiff as if it was made out of plastic; apparently, my arty-faty neighbour left on the table a part of his still life installation. Little bit annoyed, but not too much (I was still in a good mood) I went to the living room, jumped on the couch and opened my laptop.<br>Wait.<br>But I don’t live near the sea.<br>
			I closed the laptop. I felt very anxious. Where this smell then was coming from? There are no rivers or lakes or canned seaweed factories in a distance of few hundred kilometres away. I run to the balcony. There were no happy light rays anymore, as if the sun hid behind clouds, though there weren’t any. As well as the smell of the seaweed. Weird. I felt it so clearly. Are my senses playing tricks with me? Nah. I don’t care, I have so many things to do anyway.<br>
			I came back to the room, finding my laptop standing on its edge. Now I felt furious. I shouted to my neighbour,  who probably was hiding and giggling in his room: “Sam, if you touch my laptop once more, I will throw yours from the window!”.<br>Angrily, I jumped on the couch and again open my laptop. Let’s put some tunes, I thought. If I find a right music it will pump up my mood. I’ve turned on The Doors’ Indian Summer when I started hearing a scratching noise behind the shelf. The music wasn’t playing, or at least my laptop didn’t produce any sound except for slight murmuring of the hard drive. And the scratching sound continued without any stop. I stood up to check the shelf, wondering since when we are having a mice invasion. Didn’t find anything. And why the music is not playing? I tried to press a pause button. The scratching sound stopped and I’ve found myself in a total silence. Even the hard drive stopped buzzing. I pressed the button again and the scratching continued. I couldn’t find the reason of why I couldn’t hear the music — I checked all possible audio settings. The track was still playing, and when it reached the end, suddenly the mouse stopped scratching under the shelf and the raindrops started to hit the window glass. 
			<br>There were still no clouds outside.<br><br>
			What’s happening? Am I on something? I feel extremely comfortable and not dizzy at all. There was just something wrong with my hearing ability. I felt cold and I decided to put some warm socks and cover in a blanket, but the more layers of cloth I put on myself, the colder it become. <br>
			I felt exhausted. I asked myself — what is wrong with me? 
			<br><br>
			And then my mind started talking to me. <br><br>
			He said: “calm down, pal. I don’t want you to break something or go insane. Just sit, relax and listen to me.”<br><br>Wow.<br>I was disoriented. It felt like I was talking to myself but at the same time it was very distant from me. The mind continued:<br><br>“Imagine that all the things you feel today are not a part of you. They are not yours, in fact, you just receive them. They are detached from you and from me. I only interpret them.”<br><br>
